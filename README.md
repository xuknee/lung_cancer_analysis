# 🫁 Lung Cancer Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project provides an **easy-to-follow, end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of lung cancer patient data using a real-world dataset from Kaggle.  
The analysis includes:
- Patient demographics  
- Clinical features  
- Treatment outcomes  
- Diagnosis trends  

Results are visualized with clear plots and summary tables to help **researchers, students, and healthcare professionals** better understand key patterns in lung cancer epidemiology.
