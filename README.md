# Lung Cancer Data Analysis

## Overview

This project provides an easy-to-follow, end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) of lung cancer patient data, using a real-world dataset from Kaggle. The analysis covers patient demographics, clinical features, treatment outcomes, and diagnosis trends, with results visualized using clear plots and summary tables. The goal is to help researchers, students, and healthcare professionals better understand key patterns in lung cancer epidemiology.

## Dataset

The data used in this project comes from Kaggle:  
[Lung Cancer Dataset by Khwaish Saxena](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khwaishsaxena/lung-cancer-dataset)

**To get started:**
1. Download the dataset (`Lung Cancer.csv`) from the Kaggle link above.
2. Place the file in your project folder or update the file path in the notebook/code if you store it elsewhere.

## Requirements

- **Python version:** 3.7 or higher (Python 3.8/3.9/3.10+ recommended)
- **Key Python libraries:**
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - (Optional for extended analysis: `scikit-learn`, `ydata_profiling`)

**To install all required libraries, run:**
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn ydata-profiling
